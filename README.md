# Circa

A web-based system for managing requests for special collections materials. The application includes a JSON API, built in Ruby on Rails, and a default front end written in Angular.js (v. 1.6.x).

Circa provides close integration with ArchivesSpace, upon which the application depends for managing containers associated with specific collection components, as well as the location of those containers. It can also support requests for materials described in an ILS.


# System requirements

* Ruby 2.2.1 or higher
* MySQL
* Solr 5
* Redis (to support email notifications)


# Installation

These instructions should help you get a local development version up and running. Better options for providing a development environment (like Vagrant) are in the works.

## Clone repo and basic setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. `cd` into the local Circa directory (the one you just cloned)
3. Run `bundle install` to install gems
4. Run `bundle exec rake circa:generate_secrets` to generate the Rails secret\_key_base, used to validate cookies.


## Install Solr and add core

Before you can begin, you will need access to a running Solr instance. To install Solr locally:

1. Download the most recent version from http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
2. Unzip/decompress the downloaded files somewhere on your local machine
3. `cd` into the Solr root directory, e.g. 'solr-6.6.0' (the rest of these instructions assume you are in this directory)
4. Start Solr by running `bin/solr start`

Next you need to add a Solr core for Circa.

1. Create a directory for core files:<br>
`mkdir ./server/solr/circa`
2. Symlink to solr config included in this repo with this command, replacing `<full path to circa>` with the actual full path to your locally cloned copy of this repo:<br>
`ln -s <full path to circa>/solr_conf ./server/solr/circa/conf`
3. Create the core:<br>
`bin/solr create -c circa`

If you navigate (in your browser) to localhost:8983 you should see the Solr admin UI, and 'circa' should be included in the 'Core Selector' dropdown on the left. If so, you are ready to go.


## Database configuration

Database connection parameters should be stored in `config/database.yml`.
This is a standard Rails config file. For more info, see the
[Rails configuration documentation](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database)

There are 2 example files included. Select the appropriate file and rename or
save a copy as **database.yml**

**config/database-sqlite3.yml** -
To use the embedded SQLite database for evaluation or development. Use as is.

**config/database-mysql.yml** -
To use MySQL. Edit this file with the appropriate options for your database.


## Additional configuration parameters

Before using Circa you must provide configuration parameters in
`config/application.yml`. These are used to set environment variables required
by the application to facilitate communication with other systems and components.

Settings can be made per environment, with the ability to define inheritable
default values. Settings defined at the environment level will override the defaults.

The file `config/application_example.yml` can be used as a guide. The easiest
way to begin is to save a copy of this file as `config/application.yml` and
make changes as required.

> NOTE: Due to complications in conversion to Rails environment
> variables, special handling is required for boolean values:
>
> * For true, use `'1'`, or any other quoted string
>
> * Do not use false as a value, just exclude the parameter and it will not be set,
> which will have the same effect. Unfortunately, you cannot use `false` to
> override a default value of `true` - in this case you'd have to specify the value
> for each environment separately.

### ArchivesSpace connection parameters

These facilitate communication with the ArchivesSpace API and provide links to the
ArchivesSpace staff interface. Options are available to support a variety of
ArchivesSpace deployment scenarios.

* **archivesspace_host** (ex. *archivespace.yourhost.org*)<br>
The host name for the ArchivesSpace instance.
This option should be used for the 'default' ArchivesSpace deployment scenario,
with each component sharing a host but served on different ports.

* **archivesspace_backend_host** (ex. *api.archivespace.yourhost.org*)<br>
The hostname for the ArchivesSpace backend (API).
Use this option if the backend uses an unique host name. If present, this value
will override **archivesspace_host**

* **archivesspace_frontend_host** (ex. *staff.archivespace.yourhost.org*)<br>
The hostname for the ArchivesSpace frontend (staff interface).
Use this option if the frontend uses an unique host name. If present, this value
will override **archivesspace_host**

* **archivesspace_backend_port** (ex. *8089*)<br>
The port number used to connect to the ArchivesSpace backend. If your deployment
does not require a port number (e.g. for SSL) **do not include this option**.

* **archivesspace_backend_port** (ex. *8080*)<br>
The port number used to connect to the ArchivesSpace frontend. If your deployment
does not require a port number (e.g. for SSL) **do not include this option**.

* **archivesspace_username**: User name used to connect to ArchivesSpace.
User should have read access to all resources.

* **archivesspace_password**: Password associated with archivesspace_username

* **archivesspace_https**: To force connections via https, set this to '1',
otherwise leave it out.


### Solr connection parameters

These are required to connect to your Solr index.

* **solr_host** (ex. *solr.yourhost.org*): The host name of your active Solr 5 installation
* **solr_port** (ex. *8983*): The port on which your Solr instance is running
* **solr_core_name** (ex. *circa*): The name of the Solr core used by Circa
* **solr_core_path** (ex. *'/solr/circa'*): The path to the Solr core used by Circa
(relative to Solr root - include leading slash)
* **solr_https**: To force connections via https, set this to '1',
otherwise leave it out.


### Email notification parameters

Set variables required for email notifications sent by Circa.

* **order\_notification\_default_email**: Comma-separated list of email addresses to receive notifications when an order is created
* **order\_notification\_digital\_items_email**: Comma-separated list of email addresses to receive notifications when an order is created that includes digital items
* **circa_email**: 'From' email address on emails sent by Circa
* **circa\_email\_display_name**: 'From' display name on emails sent by Circa


## Set up development database

The development version will use the embedded SQLite database (MySQL is required for production). Follow these steps to prepare the database and populate it with default data used in the system.

1. Once the configuration is done, run this to set up your database:<br>
`bundle exec rake db:schema:load`
2. Populate the database with default values:<br>
`bundle exec rake db:seed`
3. Circa requires all users to log in, so you will need to create an admin user to start. Run this:<br>
`bundle exec rake users:create_admin`<br>
This will create a default admin user, with username/email: 'admin@circa' and password 'circa_admin'. You will want to edit this user from within Circa if and when you move to production or deploy to a publicly accessible server.


## Start Circa!

You should now finally be ready to run Circa locally. Start the server with<br>
`rails server -b 0.0.0.0`
Then go to localhost:3000 in your browser and log in (admin@circa/circa-admin)

The first thing you should do is to create a location representing your reading room or wherever materials will be delivered for use. Then you can try to create an Order by importing item data from ArchivesSpace.

NOTE: Referencing a record in ArchivesSpace requires knowing its URI. This plugin will make this easier by including the URI in the standard ArchivesSpace record display:

# User guide

See [User guide](user_guide/user_guide.md) for detailed instruction on using Circa. (in progress)


# Back end functionality overview

## Data model

The application defines four primary classes:

* **Order** - a request for materials
* **Item** - an individual item that can be requested and delivered for use (e.g. a box, volume, etc.)
* **User** - any person (either a staff member or a patron) associated with an order, or staff serving in an administrative capacity.
* **Location** - a physical location to or from which Items can be moved


### Orders

Orders are classified within 4 high-level order types:

* research - request for on-site use of materials for research
* reproduction - requests for reproductions of materials for off-site use or publication
* exhibition/loan - requests for long-term use for exhibition or similar purposes
* processing/preservation - requests for use of materials by staff for processing, preservation or other internal use

Each of these order types has a two or more sub-types that allow orders to be categorized more granularly.

Order types and subtypes can be used as conditions by which front end functionality can be added to or hidden from forms and displays.


### Items

All data required to create an Item in Circa comes from ArchivesSpace. ILS integration is also possible but no implementation for specific systems is included.

The process is initiated by providing Circa with the URI identifying an ArchivesSpace ArchivalObject record **[TK - SOMETHING ABOUT OUR PLUGIN FOR ADDING URI TO VIEW IN ASpace ]**. Circa will make a request to the ArchivesSpace API endpoint (including the option to resolve the associated resource) and use the data returned to create one or more Item records, determined by the number of top containers represented in the record's instances. In most cases, a single ArchivalObject record will have a single instance associated with a single top container, resulting in a single Item.

**Circa is opinionated about which containers are requestable.** It assumes that requests will be made at the top container (e.g. 'box') level, as opposed to the sub-container (e.g. 'folder') level.

When the Item is created, a corresponding Location record will be created (if a record for the same location does not already exist). Circa will assign this as the Item's permanent location. See blow for more info on Locations.


### Users

The User model is used for both researchers/patrons and for staff users of Circa. Circa uses Devise for authentication, and the User model includes all of the attributes that are provided with the Devise registration module.

Users are categorized by user role and patron type.


#### User roles

User roles provide high-level categorization of users. The default roles are:

* superadmin
* admin
* staff
* assistant
* patron

Roles are used to provide authorization of some functionality in the system (currently just for admins). Each role is assigned a level (integer) which determines the User's level of access. A user with a role with a lower level has all of the privileges of roles with higher level values.


#### Patron type

Every user, even staff, currently have to be assigned a patron type. This value is primarily for reporting purposes - there is no variable functionality associated with patron types.


### Locations

There are two kinds of locations in Circa:

1. Locations of Items' associated ArchivesSpace containers. These locations are imported from ArchivesSpace and cannot be modified in Circa.
2. Use locations, i.e. the location where materials will be transferred for use. These locations are created in Circa and can be modified.

Each item is assigned a permanent location and a current location. Upon creation these values are the same.

Each Order is assigned a use location. As Items on an Order are transferred to the Order's use location, the Item's current location is updated to the use location. Current location of Items can also be changed arbitrarily as needed.


## Record state

Circa manages state for Orders and Items, and state changes are persisted in the database to provide an audit trail.

For each model, a corresponding state configuration file (<model_name>\_state_config.rb) can be found in app/models/concerns/. This file is used to define states, events that trigger transition to a specific state, rules defining conditions under which specific events/state changes are permitted, and callback methods to be executed after state changes have been completed.


## JSON API

Communication between the front-end and data stores (application database, Solr, ArchivesSpace, library catalog) is accomplished via a JSON API. See [API documentation](api.md) for more information.


## Solr configuration

The directory `solr_conf` includes configuration files for use with Solr 5. To use it, first create a new Solr core called 'circa'. By default, your core will include a directory called `conf` containing configuration files. Delete this directory and create a symbolic link from `conf` to the `solr_conf` directory in the location where Circa is deployed.

Alternately, you can specify the location of the custom config directory within the `core.properties` file in your core.


## Background job queuing

Circa uses the Active Job framework (included with Rails) to handle background jobs (primarily for sending email notifications asynchronously). Active Job is configured to use the [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) library for its queuing backend. Resque uses Redis, which must be installed and running on the server on which Circa is installed.
