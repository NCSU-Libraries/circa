## Release procedure

Releases are pulled automatically by Ansible Galaxy, whenever new release is published on github.

So all you have to do is [create new release](https://github.com/rvm/rvm1-ansible/releases/new) adding a tag to the master branch and copying entries from [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
