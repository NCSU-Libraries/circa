# Locations

Circa manages two distinct types of locations:

* temporary locations, where materials will be used
* permanent locations, where materials are stored

Only temporary locations can be created and edited within the system. Permanent locations are imported from ArchivesSpace when an Item is created. These correspond to the location of the top container associated with an instance. The permanent location of an Item is automatically assigned when it is added.

One temporary location can be specified as the default and will be automatically selected as the use location when a new Order is created.

## Locations list

The first view available when selecting 'Locations' from the main menu is a list of temporary locations managed by Circa. To view the details for a location, click the 'View' button.

## Location details

After clicking 'View' form the locations list, the user will be presented with a few additional details about the location, if available. From this view, the user can choose to edit or delete the Location. Note that the option to delete is only available if the Location is not associated with a confirmed Order.

## Create a new location

To create an item, click the 'Create new location' link at the top of the list view. On the page that follows:

* Enter the name of the location
* Check the 'Default?' checkbox if this location should be used as the default (if another location is already set as default, checking this box will disable the default option form that Location)
* Enter notes about this location as needed

## Editing a location

To edit a location, click the 'edit' link from the location details page. The same options listed above for creating a location will be available here.
